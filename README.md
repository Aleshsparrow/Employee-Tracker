# Employee-Tracker
As the business owner, it is of utmost importance to be able track the enumber of employees, departments, amount spent on salaries and various other things.

I wrote this program in order to be able to easily monitor the important details in order to make the business run smoothly.

I used "inquirer" npm package and "mysql" npm package for this program.
